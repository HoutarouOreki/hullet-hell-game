	It's changing its course in an unnatural way. I think it is going to approach you.
	I will try to establish communication.
Player:
	Ok.
	Shit... This spells big trouble. I don't have good enough engines or even enough fuel to attempt escaping.
	...
	...
	.........
Sergeant:
	Weird, I cannot establish communication. But it is definitely a manned ship, it's intentionally heading your way. Get ready for the encounter.
Player:
	I'm starting to see it...
