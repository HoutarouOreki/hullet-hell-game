Lieutenant:
	We're giving you access to two new spaceships more fit for combat than what you were using.
	The USSF Thomson 2 is a very agile ship turbo-enabled engines and rapid-firing cannons, but it's very delicate.
	The USSF Beetle 1 is tougher and can launch explosives, but it's quite heavy and fires at a slow rate.
	You can find them in the garage. We've also prepared a test course so that you can check them out in practice.
	That's all for now.
